Given an array of string, group the strings that are composed by the same character, returning an array of arrays.

    For example, given:
    ["124", "412", "425", "241", "524", "324", "2141"],
    
    Return:
        [
            ["241", "124","412"],
            ["524","425"],
            ["324"],
            ["2141"]
        ]
